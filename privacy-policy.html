      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Vivani</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses,
        and protects information in connection with our website and our presence on platforms such as
        Pinterest and Instagram.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We do not directly collect personal information such as your name or email address unless you
        voluntarily contact us. However, our website and third-party services we use may automatically
        collect certain technical information, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>IP address and approximate location</li>
        <li>Browser type and device information</li>
        <li>Pages visited and time spent on our site</li>
        <li>Referring website or link (for example, from Pinterest)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is generally collected in an aggregated and anonymized form and is used for
        analytics and to improve our content.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        We and our service providers may use cookies and similar technologies to understand how visitors
        use our website, to improve usability, and to measure the performance of our content and affiliate
        links. You can control or disable cookies through your browser settings, though some features of
        the site may not function as intended if cookies are disabled.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Affiliate Links and Third-Party Sites</h2>
      <p>
        Some of the products we share are linked using affiliate links. This means we may earn a small
        commission if you make a purchase after clicking such a link, at no extra cost to you. When you
        follow an affiliate link, you are taken to a third-party website (such as an online retailer),
        whose own terms and privacy policies will apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of third-party websites and recommend
        that you review their policies before providing any personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We may use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyze and improve our website and content</li>
        <li>Understand which pages and products are of interest to visitors</li>
        <li>Monitor traffic patterns and trends</li>
        <li>Maintain the security and integrity of our website</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not sell or rent your personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We may share non-identifiable, aggregated information with service providers or partners who help
        us operate our website, such as analytics providers or hosting providers. We may also disclose
        information if required to do so by law or in order to protect our rights, property, or safety.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our content is intended for a general audience and is not specifically directed at children under
        the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you
        believe that a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so we can remove it.
      </p>

      <h2>7. International Visitors</h2>
      <p>
        If you visit our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may
        be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States or other countries where our service
        providers are located. By using our website, you consent to this transfer.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last updated"
        date at the top of this page. Your continued use of our website after any changes indicates your
        acceptance of the updated policy.
